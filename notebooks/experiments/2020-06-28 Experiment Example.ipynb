    "Using RMSE, we found that a simple linear regressor had about a 0.2cm error. Ridge regression performed slightly worse with default parameters, as expected as there were only three features to begin with. As action items, we should visualize the data in more detail to understand how the features interrelate with each other."

    "1. Set up the notebook so it can be run directly by anyone without issue. This way, any other person can reproduce your results or do a deep dive if needed.\n",

    "3. Try using a tool like [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to remove output from cells when committing."
